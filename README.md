##Idea

Make a social network classified by neighborhoods in which residents can register and see news related to the community, aid and advice to combat covid-19 apart a chat with which they can meet among the inhabitants of the neighborhood and establish communication in this period of quarantine, coming to socialize project agreements, ideas or neighborhood improvements with joint participation of each of the neighbors.

##Inspiration

The inspiration is born at the moment to think and to see that it is necessary that each one of the districts deserve a space of opinion, communication between the neighbors, with the purpose of arriving to have agreements in projects that can be made, to make know perhaps of a new business that opened xyz neighbor and thus to support not only the neighbors but to the directors of each district also.

##What it does?

Each neighbour will register, will have access to a news section in which he will visualize the most recent news, chat for the neighbourhood communication between the inhabitants of the same.
