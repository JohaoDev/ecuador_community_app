## Idea
Make a social network classified by neighborhoods in which residents can register and see news related to the community, aid and advice to combat covid-19 apart a chat with which they can meet among the inhabitants of the neighborhood and establish communication in this period of quarantine, coming to socialize project agreements, ideas or neighborhood improvements with joint participation of each of the neighbors.

## Inspiration
The inspiration is born at the moment to think and to see that it is necessary that each one of the districts deserve a space of opinion, communication between the neighbors, with the purpose of arriving to have agreements in projects that can be made, to make know perhaps of a new business that opened xyz neighbor and thus to support not only the neighbors but to the directors of each district also.

## What it does
Each neighbour will register, will have access to a news section in which he will visualize the most recent news, chat for the neighbourhood communication between the inhabitants of the same. 

## How I built it?
I used React Native to build the mobile application, TailwindCSS for the styles and several extra dependencies for icons, and creation of the application test apk.

## Challenges I ran into
Getting used to the way of declaring styles in React Native TailwindCSS, change most classes but have the same functionality as doing it in a web project.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Create the visual part of this mobile application from scratch, without the help of other programmers, designers, etc. In the future if I want to make it a reality I will have to go to them, to apply their recommendations.

## What I learned?
How to make a type of mobile application similar or identical to social networks.

## What's next for Ecuador Community?
Mature the idea, improve it and present it to the authorities to distribute it and use it as a means of information for the neighbourhoods, starting with the neighbourhood of San Blas (Quito, Ecuador).
